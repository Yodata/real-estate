title: Multiple Listing Service
description: >
  A multiple listing service (MLS, also multiple listing system or multiple
  listings service) is a suite of services that real estate brokers use to
  establish contractual offers of compensation (among brokers) and accumulate
  and disseminate information to enable appraisals. A multiple listing service's
  database and software is used by real estate brokers in real estate (or
  aircraft broker[1] in other industries for example), representing sellers
  under a listing contract to widely share information about properties with
  other brokers who may represent potential buyers or wish to work with a
  seller's broker in finding a buyer for the property or asset. The listing data
  stored in a multiple listing service's database is the proprietary information
  of the broker who has obtained a listing agreement with a property's seller.
