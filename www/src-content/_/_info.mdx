# Let&#x27;s Integrate Real Estate

**Version: 0.0.2**

## WHAT
Yodata/Real-Estate is an open source collaborative effort between real estate technology brokers, 
agents and technolgy providers working to normalize data and application integrations.

## HOW
Applications connect to a shared event bus controlled by the user (customer of the vendor).
The event models are stored in Github and maintained by the community of developers and partners.
