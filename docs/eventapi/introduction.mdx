# Introduction

## What

Yodata Real Estate is a collaborative effort to normalize application data integration in and around the real estate domain.

## Mission

##


## How does it work?

Applications generate notifications about activities, interactions, and new information, which may be presented to the user or processed further.
This allows for more modular systems, which decouple data storage from the applications which display or otherwise make use of the data.

Senders, receivers and consumers are independently implemented and run on different technology stacks, 
and share a common message schema which is developed by the community and hosted on Github as open-source.

## Features

- Maintain up-to-date data across a variety of systems in real-time
- Be aware of data changes as they happen
- Share data with other authorized parties
- REflex leverages the latest in “pub/sub” event message bus technology
  - When data changes in one system, the owner of that system will “publish” a data change event to the REflex “message bus”. 
  - Authorized parties are allowed to “subscribe” to the REflex message bus, so that they are notified about:
    - What data fields changed
    - How the data values changed
    - When the data was changed
    - Who changed the data
    - Other helpful metadata about the data event
  - Examples:
    - An Agent’s last name has changed in HSF’s CRM. Authorized vendors are notified of this event and can update their systems accordingly.
    - A new customer lead has come through the website. Authorized vendors are notified of this event and can
make the lead available in their systems for the Agent to work with.
- Constantly evolving features/functionality:
  - New types of vendors constantly added to the REflex ecosystem
    - For example, CRM vendors, Marketing vendors, transaction data vendors, etc
  - New data types constantly added to the REflex ecosystem
    - For example, Agent roster data, Customer lead data, etc
  - New security and data filtering/metadata capabilities constantly being evolved in the REflex ecosystem
    - For example, establishing which vendors can access which types of data events from which sources
