SoftPro events will be authenticated by API Key in the http request header.

Reflex is intended to normalize the process of integrating applications and services
in the real estate domain in a user-centric, vendor agnostic and developer friendly
way.

The API is very simple, the only interactions are publish a message (HTTP POST) and get messages either pushed to your 
application or with HTTP GET.

The project is 100% open source and contributors are welcomed with open arms.

To get started you'll need to get yourself a POD that will provide your application's private message bus.

If you don't already have a pod, contact us and we'll get you setup.
