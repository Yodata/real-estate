## Process
To allow incoming and outgoing communication with other pods, two special resources are available:
- Inbox to receive messages
- Outbox to send messages

They are considered Containers in the Linked Data specification, giving it the same functionality
as a folder which you can list the content of via paging (*N* items per page) and use the items name
to fetch their content.

## Inbox
Your pod has a default Inbox available at `/inbox/`, which is also the default location when other
pods attempt to discover your inbox location using your pod's profile card, located at `/profile/card#me`

### Use your inbox
#### Basic
When you are first given access to your pod, you'll directly be able to query your inbox content with your
API key. Your inbox will be empty at first until data comes in or you send data yourself.

To list your inbox content:
```http
GET /inbox/ HTTP/1.1
X-API-Key: myApiKey

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "next": "DFDSlkdfslk345434",
    "contains": [
        "https://pod.example.org/inbox/1",
        "https://pod.example.org/inbox/2",
        "https://pod.example.org/inbox/3",
        "https://pod.example.org/inbox/4",
        "https://pod.example.org/inbox/5"
    ]
}
```
You can then fetch each message and process it. Once you want to go to the next page, you use the value of `next`
as a query parameter with the key `from`, like so:
```http
GET /inbox/?from=DFDSlkdfslk345434 HTTP/1.1
X-API-Key: myApiKey

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "contains": []
}
```
If `next` is not present of empty, you have reached the end of the paging. You can keep using the value until there
is new data.

#### Customize
You can use the following query parameters to customize the response:

| Key      | Type   | Description                                                                                               |
|----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `from`   | String | Opaque string use for fetching the next page of content using a specific type of token                    |
| `by`     | String | Enum with the values `token` (used with `next`), `timestamp`                                              |
| `format` | String | Enum with the values `full` (display the content of each element within the listing) or `links` (default) |

## Outbox
Your pod has a default Outbox available at `/outbox/` which is used to send messages to other pods with the corrent
format and IDs.

### Use your outbox
Let's say you want to send the following message to `https://other-pod.example.org/profile/card#me`:
```json
{
    "type": "TestAction",
    "topic": "test",
    "Hello": "World!"
}
```

You need to add the `@to` key which defines the recipient of the message. The key/value will be removed before
being sent to the remote party.

You perform a `POST` request to `/outbox/` with your API key to send the data to the remote pod:
```http
POST /outbox/ HTTP/1.1
X-API-Key: myApiKey
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "@to": "https://other-pod.example.org/profile/card#me",
    "type": "TestAction",
    "topic": "test",
    "Hello": "World!"
}
```
You will get a reponse with the message ID as stored in your outbox:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": "https://pod.example.org/oubox/12345abcdef"
}
```

Your pod will then be notified of the message present in your outbox and delivery it to the `/inbox` of the remote pod.
The other pod owner will query its inbox like described above to process your message.
