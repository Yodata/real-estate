# Introduction

# Real Estate

**Version: 0.0.1**

Reflex is intended to normalize the process of integrating applications and services
in the real estate domain in a user-centric, vendor agnostic and developer friendly
way.

The API is very simple, the only interactions are publish a message (HTTP POST) and get messages either pushed to your 
application or with HTTP GET.

The project is 100% open source and contributors are welcomed with open arms.

To get started you'll need to get yourself a POD that will provide your application's private message bus.

If you don't already have a pod, contact us and we'll get you setup.
