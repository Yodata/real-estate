# Using Service Area Data (WORK-IN-PROGRESS)

**General Info**

Real estate brokerages contract with HSF Affiliates to become franchisees within one of its franchises, such as Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. Each franchisee has permission to complete real estate transactions within certain cities and/or zip codes. The geographic locations within which a franchisee has permission to do business are called Effective Service Areas, aka ESAs or ServiceAreas.

Leads are routed to an office within a franchisee called the "relocation office". Most franchisees have just one relocation office, but large franchisees may have more than one. In those cases, each relocation office handles different ESAs for the franchisee. For this reason, ESAs are assigned to specific relocation offices and not just to franchisees themselves.

It is possible that more than one franchisee has permission to service a city or zip code. For that reason, each ESA includes a Sort Order that tells vendors the order in which to display relocation offices associated with the ESAs for the selected city or zip code. Each ESA also includes a Weight so that vendors know how to route leads to franchisees' relocation offices.

There may be instances where an ESA should be recognized for one business purpose but not for another. For example, one of franchisee XX999's ESAs might be available for use in broker-to-broker referrals but not for lead routing. Each ESA record includes attributes that specify how the information can be used. Each vendor must look at the attribute that represents their type of business and use or ignore ESA information accordingly.

**Geographic** **Details**

If a franchisee services multiple cities and/or zip codes (and they usually do), then there will be multiple ServiceArea records for the franchisee -- one per city or zip code that is serviced.

Each ServiceArea record includes EITHER a combination of data that defines the city serviced by the franchisee OR a combination of data that defines the zip code serviced by the franchisee. The areaServed object will not include more than one combination in per Service Area record.

**Example 1**: If the ServiceArea is for the city of Pine Hills, FL then the following info would be provided.

```json
{
  "type": "ServiceArea",
  "kind": "City",
  "postalCode": "91371",
  "addressLocality": "Woodland Hills",
  "addressRegion": "CA",
  "addressCountry": "US",
  "addressCounty": "Los Angeles",
}
```

**Example 2**: If the ServiceArea is for the US zip code of 91371 then the following info would be provided.

```json
{
  "type": "ServiceArea",
  "kind": "PostalCode",
  "postalCode": "91371",
  "addressLocality": "Woodland Hills",
  "addressRegion": "CA",
  "addressCountry": "US",
  "addressCounty": "Los Angeles",
}
```


If the ServiceArea defines a zip code in which the franchisee has a physical office then additionalProperty.officeInZipCode will be set to True.

**Franchisee** **Details**

The franchisee servicing the area defined in the ServiceArea record is specified in the member object.

-   member.type = RealEstateOrganization

-   member.id = *the url for the franchisee's profile*

The specific relocation office servicing the area defined in the ServiceArea record is specified in the RelocationOffice object (within the additionalProperty object).

-   additionalProperty.relocationOffice.type = RealEstateOffice

<!-- -->

-   additionalProperty.relocationOffice.id = *the url for the relocation office's profile*

-   -   -   -   -   -   -

**Sorting Rules**

**Vendors** **must** **use the** **value in the additionalProperty.SortOrder field** **to determine** **the order in which to** **display** **relocation offices associated with ServiceArea records, where 0 is listed first and 9 is listed last.**

-   **Example: If franchisees** **XX999,** **YY999, and ZZ999 all** **service** **zip code 91371** **then** **the** **vendor must look at the ServiceArea records for** **91371** **for** **all three** **franchisees. If franchisee XX999's ServiceArea record has a Sort Order of 5, YY999's ServiceArea record has a Sort Order of 9, and ZZ999's ServiceArea record has a Sort Order of 0, then the relocation offices for those franchisees would be displayed in the following order: 1) ZZ999, 2) XX999, 3) YY999**

-   **If** **ServiceArea records have the same Sort Order then the franchisee's ID must be used as the secondary sort order.**

**Routing Rules**

**Vendors using data for lead routing purposes** **must use the value in the additionalProperty.weight field** **in the ServiceArea records** **to** **determine routing,** **where the value represents a ratio in** **the** **relationship to other franchisees** **servicing the same area.**

-   **Example 1:** **If franchisees XX999, YY999, and ZZ999** **all** **service zip code 91371 then** **the** **vendor must look at the ServiceArea records for all three franchisees. If all records have** **a** **Weight** **of 1,** **then** **the ratio is 1:1:1. This** **means** **leads must be equally distributed between** **the** **franchisees in a round robin.**

-   **Example 2: If franchisees** **AA999,** **BB999, and** **CC999 each have ServiceArea records for** **Pine** **Hills, FL** **then the vendor must look at the ServiceArea records for all three franchisees. If franchisee** **AA999's** **ServiceArea record** **has a Weight of 2,** **BB999's** **ServiceArea record has a Weight of 3, and CC999's ServiceArea record** **has** **a Weight** **of 1 then** **the ratio is 2:3:1. That means** **two leads must be routed to** **AA999, then** **three** **leads must be routed to** **BB999, then one** **lead** **must be routed** **to** **CC999.**

**Which** **Service Area** **Records** **May Be** **Used**

**Vendors** **may only use** **ServiceArea** **data for their system** **when** **the attribute corresponding to the their** **primary** **type of business is set to True.**

-   **Vendors** **that** **primarily** **use ServiceArea data** **to display information in HSF's** **Company Locator** **app** **must look at the value in** **the** **additionalProperty.sentToCompanyLocator** **field.**

-   -   -   **Vendors that** **primarily** **use ServiceArea data to route leads to** **franchisees based on searches performed in a consumer site** **must look at the value in** **the** **additionalProperty.sentToConsumerSite** **field.** **Current vendors include:**

    -   **Buyside**

    -   **ProspectConverter**

    -   **Smarter Agent**

-   -   **Vendors that** **primarily** **use ServiceArea data to** **support** **broker-to-broker referrals must look at the value in the** **additionalProperty.sentToReloSpec field.** **Current vendors include:**

    -   **HomeStory**

    -   **ReloSpec**

Each vendor should look at only one of these attributes to determine whether or not they can use ServiceArea data. For example, ProspectConverter should only look at the value in the **additionalProperty.sentToConsumerSite field. It should ignore** **the** **values in the** **additionalProperty.sentToCompanyLocator and additionalProperty.sentToReloSpec fields.**
