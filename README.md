## Let's Integrate!

### About the project

We are a community of software developers that are uniting to make application and data integrations easier.  How?  We leverage the power of shared data standards paired with open/interoperable systems to free the movement of data.

Utilizing shared data standards reduces the cost and time monitoring/maintaining multiple API integrations that use the same data, but in different proprietary formats.  When we agree on how data is structured, we create an ecosystem of rapid innovation!

This project is not a single platform to rule them all.  IT IS using the magic of shared data models to move data between applications efficiently, in real time so you can use and store your data how you want.

We provide a developer portal with tools to build, test, validate your data integrations.  Together we will revolutionize application integration based on common sense.


### Project Mission & Goals

- Shared standards for all data points.
- Decentralized data (Customer Control).
- Software is integrated by default.
- No vendor lock-in.
- No customer lock-out!
- Rapid development.

#### Shared Standards
When we agree upon a set of standards we become a network of interconnected vendors and partners.  The data library continues to expand as collectively we build, enhance and use new data models.  


#### Decentralized Data
A core tenant is that you own and control your data.  We apply open schemas for event-drive messaging based on industry standards such as RESO and Schema.org.  There is no data lake that you must map and maintain.  All data flowing through the message bus to you is controlled and maintained by you.

#### Software is Integrated by Default
You only need to integrate once.  By using the same schemas, your integration work is already done.  Your new partner maps their data to the schemas and you just connect and your data flows.  We’re leveraging the Network Effect.


#### No Vendor Lock-in
Using an open schema integration framework – you always have control of your data.  As much as we would like, no partner lasts forever.  Next new thing – No worry. You’re not dependent on your old vendor. When you control your data – you simply connect and start sharing data.  You’ll always be competitive.


#### No Customer Lock Out
Integrations are expensive.  We only have so much development bandwidth.  By using a common set of standards, new applications and partners can integrate quickly and easily.  You just have to turn them on and data will flow seamlessly in the format you are already using!


#### Rapid Development
The Developer Portal provides all the tools you need to build your APIs, integrate the schema, test with data and validate.  Leverage the existing ecosystem of working code and create and maintain your integration with minimum effort.
