name: Publishing events as another entity
menu: API

## Overview

As a publisher, to facilitate the publication of events on behalf of another entity, a dedicated publish endpoint can be used that will ensure:

- Relevant keys are added.
- Event is stored in the right location on the other entity's pod using the `topic`

This mechanism should not be used to publish events about your own entity. This is a helper endpoint for publishers to ensure the low-level mechanisms are handled in a coherent manner.

## Usage

The following steps will use the default example values, adapt as needed:

- Publisher's pod is `https://publisher.example.com`
- The other entity's pod is `https://entity.example.com`
- An example event data `{"type": "test", "hello": "world"}`

Send the event to your own pod's publish endpoint, which will return the event ID, just like `/inbox/` and `/outbox/`.

```http
POST /publish/ HTTP/1.1
Host: publisher.example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "recipient": "https://entity.example.com/profile/card#me",
    "topic": "realestate/example#action",
    "datacontenttype": "application/json",
    "data": {
        "type": "test",
        "hello": "world"
    }
}
```

The format mandates that:

- The `recipient` key is to be set to the Linked-Data URI of the entity that the publisher is acting on behalf of. This key and value will be removed from the final event.

- The `topic` key is mandatory and will be used in the entity pod to compute the right container.

If the publish is successful, the event will be deleted from the `/publish/` container. Processing can range from instant to several minutes.

The following keys will be added to the event to make it compliant with the pubsub system:

- `agent` with the entity's identity
- `instrument` with the publisher's identity
- `timestamp` as a millisecond Epoch timestamp
- `time` as an ISO formatted date

## Outcome

Once published, the event will appear in the appropriate event container on the entity pod. Following the **Usage** example, the event would be stored under `https://entity.example.com/event/topic/realestate/example/`.

If the generated ID was `abcde12345`, the event would be available at:

```http
GET /event/topic/realestate/example/abcde12345 HTTP/1.1
Host: entity.example.com

Content-Type: application/json

{
    "agent": "https://entity.example.com/profile/card#me",
    "instrument": https://publisher.example.com/profile/card#me",
    "timestamp": 1555097126000,
    "time": "2019-04-12T19:25:26Z",
    "topic": "realestate/example#action",
    "datacontenttype": "application/json",
    "data": {
        "type": "test",
        "hello": "world"
    }
}
```
