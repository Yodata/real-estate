    ## WHAT
    Yodata/Real-Estate is an open source collaborative effort between real estate technology brokers, 
    agents and technolgy providers working to normalize data and application integrations.

    ## HOW
    Applications connect to a shared event bus controlled by the user (customer of the vendor).
    The event models are stored in Github and maintained by the community of developers and partners.

      ## Permission model

      The Events API leverages existing object-driven OAuth scope system to
      control access to events. For example, if your app has access to profiles
      through the `profiles:read` scope, you can choose to subscribe to any or
      none of the profile-related events like `profile_added` and
      `profile_updated`.

      You will only receive events from users who've authorized your app.
