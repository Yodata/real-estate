REflex is a user-centric pub/sub system that uses [Linked Data Notifications (LDN)](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldn/) to enable sharing and reuse of notifications across applications, regardless of how they were generated. 

Instead of treating notifications as ephemeral or non-persistent entities, this specification enables the notion of a notification as an individual entity with its own URI. As such, notifications can be retrieved and reused. 

The API is very simple, the only interactions are publish a message (HTTP POST) and get messages either pushed to your application or with HTTP GET.  All the magic is in the [schemas](schema-introduction.md)
