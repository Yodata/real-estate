## Overview

Use the publish API to send events to your user's PODs for distribution to that user's subscribers.

### Published Event Data Flow

```sequence
[ your app (producer) ] => [ user pod (publisher) ] => [ other user apps (subscribers) ]
```

## Usage

To publish an event, HTTP POST to your pod's /publish/ endpoint with a content-type of application/json and the event in the body.

```http
POST /publish/
Host: {your-pod-host}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "recipient": "https://{user-pod}/profile/card#me",
    "source": "https://{participant-pod/profile/card#me"
    "topic": "{domain}/{topic}#{actiontype}",
    "data": {
        "type": "{actiontype}"
        ... payload
    }
}
```

### Example

Let's imagine your user has added a new CRM contact and you want to publish that event.

Assumptions:
- Your pod is producer.example.com
- Your user's pod is user.example.com
- A participant pod will receive a copy of this event
- The new contact is named "Bruce Wayne"

```sh
curl -X POST \
https://producer.example.com/publish/ \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'x-api-key: {your-secret}' \
-d '[
  {
    "recipient": "https://user.example.com/profile/card#me",
    "source": "https://participant.example.com/profile/card#me"
    "topic": "realestate/contact#add",
    "data": {
        "type": "AddAction",
        "object": {
            "type": "Contact",
            "name": "Bruce Wayne"
        }
  }
]'
```

## Outcome

Once published, the event will be distributued to authorized subscribers of the user pod.

Subscribers recieve the event created by the producer, with some additional meta data.

```json
{
    "topic": "{published topic}",
    "instrument": "{producer pod URI}",
    "agent": "{user (publisher) pod URI}",
    "data": {
        ... payload
  }
```
