# Subscription Types

## Permission model

The Events API leverages existing object-driven OAuth scope system to
control access to events. For example, if your app has access to profiles
through the `profiles:read` scope, you can choose to subscribe to any or
none of the profile-related events like `profile_added` and
`profile_updated`.

You will only receive events from users who've authorized your app.
