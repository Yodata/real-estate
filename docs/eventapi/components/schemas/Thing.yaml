    type: string
    description:
      An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
      types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a
      relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa
      syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof'
      attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker
      understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
