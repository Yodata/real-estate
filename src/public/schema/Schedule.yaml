title: Schedule
type: object
description: >
  A schedule defines a repeating time period used to describe a regularly
  occurring Event. At a minimum a schedule will specify repeatFrequency which
  describes the interval between occurences of the event. Additional information
  can be provided to specify the schedule more precisely. This includes
  identifying the day(s) of the week or month when the recurring event will take
  place, in addition to its start and end time. Schedules may also have start
  and end dates to indicate when they are active, e.g. to define a limited
  calendar of events.
