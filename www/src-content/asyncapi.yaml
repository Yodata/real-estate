  title: Standard Events for Integrating Real Estate Software
  version: '0.0.2'
  description: |

    This document describes an event vocabulary for automating business processes across organizational boundaries in the residential real estate domain.

    The vocabulary and related libraries are 100% open-source software actively maintained by a small but passionate community of developers and supported by forward-thinking real estate businesses.

    ## Technical Acknowledgments
    The Real Estate vocabulary is largely based on the tremendous work being done at schema.org.

    The Profile schema comes from the SOLID project developed at MIT.

    And all of the above can be traced directly to the work of the incomparable Tim Berners-Lee.

      ## Permission model

      The Events API leverages existing object-driven OAuth scope system to
      control access to events. For example, if your app has access to profiles
      through the `profiles:read` scope, you can choose to subscribe to any or
      none of the profile-related events like `profile_added` and
      `profile_updated`.

      You will only receive events from users who've authorized your app.
